# About me
I am a digital and AI artist, musician/producer, web developer and technical architect.

I have been a professional in the fields of art, design and IT for over two decades. Since early 2022, I've been exploring web3, NFTs and AI art. Through communities and building connections in the web3 space, I've unlocked a passion in me for creating AI art, using various digital tools to visualise inspiring narrative and express my artistic thoughts. This exploration and outlet has helped me understand and work with my own mental health challenges.

I've created 3 NFT collections so far - the [Meta Alchemists](https://opensea.io/collection/meta-alchemists), [Alien Street Art Club](https://opensea.io/collection/alien-street-art-club) and [Eyeverse AI](https://opensea.io/collection/eyeverse-ai).

I'm open to commissions and collaborations.
